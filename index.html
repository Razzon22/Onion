		<p>We all know that onions can make us cry when we cut them raw. But after they're cooked, they stop making our eyes water and start making our mouth water! After onions are cooked, they can give a sweetish, mellow flavor. Sometimes you don't recognize that onions are in a dish, but once they're taken out, it's easy to notice something's missing.</p>
		<p>There are some people that cook and eat just the onion, but it's much more common when people use them cooking a recipe. There are many fancy dishes around the world that use onions to add that extra taste, and some dishes use onions as the main ingredient. Here are just a couple of the many things that people can make with onions.<br><br></p>

		<p>Creamed Pearl Onions look a lot like shell noodles, but they probably taste nothing like them. Grab some pearl onions, make cream and add toppings after cooking them, and you've got yourself some delicious creamy pearl onions. (but it probably takes more than that.) Full recipe <a href='https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/creamed-pearl-onions/'>here</a>.</p>

		<p>Green Onion rolls look like croissants, but I'm not sure if they taste like croissants. (I haven't eaten either of these dishes.) But croissant or not, they're still delicious. Saute the onions, add it to bread and a bunch of other things (more specific instructions <a href='https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/green-onion-rolls/'>here</a>, probably takes more than that) and you've got some green onion rolls.</p>
